		Suppose an internet company wishes to install as few monitoring stations as possible to make sure their lines are clean.  Suppose also that a group of friends wishes to order <a href="http://xkcd.com/287/">exactly $15.05</a> worth of appetizers at a local restaurant.  What do these seemingly unrelated problems have in common?  As crazy as it seems, the first type of problem can be turned into problems of the second type - thanks to what is known as a <b>reduction</b>.

		Background: this semester, I took Algorithms as my last required graduate course.  Even though I had taken an undergrad version of the course and had seen NP-complete problems before, the idea of reduction didn't really sink in until this semester. Now that I better understand them, I think they are pretty cool and wanted to share my understandings.
