		Suppose an internet company wishes to install as few monitoring stations as possible to make sure their lines are clean.  Suppose also that a group of friends wishes to order <a href="http://xkcd.com/287/">exactly $15.05</a> worth of appetizers at a local restaurant.  What do these seemingly unrelated problems have in common?  As crazy as it seems, the first type of problem can be turned into problems of the second type - thanks to what is known as a <b>reduction</b>.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Background: this semester, I took Algorithms as my last required graduate course.  Even though I had taken an undergrad version of the course and had seen NP-complete problems before, the idea of reduction didn't really sink in until this semester. Now that I better understand them, I think they are pretty cool and wanted to share my understandings.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	As an example of the second type of problem, I'll defer to XKCD:
	<a href="http://xkcd.com/287/"><img src="/images/subset_sum_xkcd.png"/></a>
	<br/>

	There are two correct solutions to this appetizers problem, seven orders of mixed fruit <b>or</b> two hot wings, one mixed fruit and a sampler.
	These are the only two ways to get <b>exactly</b> $15.05 worth of appetizers.
	This type of problem is known as a <span class="mouseOverMe" title='The original comic says "knapsack problem", referring to the original knapsack problem, which has since evolved into subset sum.  A modern knapsack version of the appetizers would have the group of friends optimizing for the most calories they could buy with $15.05'>modern</span> subset sum (SS) problem.

	So, we have our Vertex Cover problem and our Subset Sum problem. 
	How on earth do we make one like the other?  
	And why would we want to?
