		Suppose an Internet company wishes to install monitoring stations at various junctions to make sure their lines are clean.  Suppose also that a group of friends wishes to order <a href="http://xkcd.com/287/">exactly $15.05</a> worth of appetizers at a local restaurant.  What do these seemingly unrelated problems have in common?  As crazy as it seems, the first type of problem can be turned into problems of the second type - thanks to what is known as a <b>reduction</b>.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	As an example of the second type of problem, I'll defer to XKCD:
	<a href="http://xkcd.com/287/"><img src="/images/subset_sum_xkcd.png"/></a>
	<br/>

	There are two correct solutions to this appetizers problem, seven orders of mixed fruit <b>or</b> two hot wings, one mixed fruit and a sampler.
	These are the only two ways to get <b>exactly</b> $15.05 worth of appetizers.
	This type of problem is known as a <span class="mouseOverMe" title='The original comic says "knapsack problem", referring to the original knapsack problem, which has since evolved into subset sum.  A modern knapsack version of the appetizers would have the group of friends optimizing for the most calories they could buy with $15.05'>modern</span> subset sum (SS) problem.
	</p>

	<p>
	So, we have our Vertex Cover problem and our Subset Sum problem. 
	How on earth do we make one like the other?  
	And why would we want to?
