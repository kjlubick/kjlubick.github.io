		Suppose an internet company wishes to install as few monitoring stations as possible to make sure their lines are clean.  Suppose also that a group of friends wishes to order <a href="http://xkcd.com/287/">exactly $15.05</a> worth of appetizers at a local restaurant.  What do these seemingly unrelated problems have in common?  As crazy as it seems, the first type of problem can be turned into problems of the second type - thanks to what is known as a <b>reduction</b>.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Background: this semester, I took Algorithms as my last required graduate course.  Even though I had taken an undergrad version of the course and had seen NP-complete problems before, the idea of reduction didn't really sink in until this semester. Now that I better understand them, I think they are pretty cool and wanted to share my understandings.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	As an example of the second type of problem, I'll defer to XKCD:
	<a href="http://xkcd.com/287/"><img src="/images/subset_sum_xkcd.png"/></a>
	<br/>

	There are two correct solutions to this appetizers problem, seven orders of mixed fruit <b>or</b> two hot wings, one mixed fruit and a sampler.
	These are the only two ways to get <b>exactly</b> $15.05 worth of appetizers.
	This type of problem is known as a <span class="mouseOverMe" title='The original comic says "knapsack problem", referring to the original knapsack problem, which has since evolved into subset sum.  A modern knapsack version of the appetizers would have the group of friends optimizing for the most calories they could buy with $15.05'>modern</span> subset sum (SS) problem.
	</p>

	<p>
	So, we have our Vertex Cover problem and our Subset Sum problem. 
	How on earth do we make one like the other?  
	And why would we want to?

		<h3>How to transform Vertex Cover into Subset Sum?</h3>
		<p>
		As a preface, let me make it clear that <b>coming up with these transformations takes divine inspiration</b> and an average person (like me) is not expected to do so.
		</p>

		<p>
		In order to have a valid transformation, we have to be able to turn any form of one problem (VC) into a form of the other problem (SS).
		Additionally, if we take the solution to the first problem (VC), we should be able to easily transform it into a solution of the second problem (SS).
		Most importantly, if we solve the transformed problem (SS), it should <b>always</b> be able to be transformed into a valid solution to the first problem (VC).
		An example of this done incorrectly is later in this post.
		</p>

		<p>
		Somehow we need to create a set of numbers (appetizers) and come up with a target number (target expenditures) from a bunch of vertexes (servers) and edges (connections).
		More importantly, if we find a subset of those numbers that add up to the magic target number, we had better be able to turn the subset of numbers into a subset of vertexes that make sure each edge is covered at least once.
		<br/>
		That transformation is as follows: 
		</p>

		<p>
		1. Give each vertex and edge a name.  
		I've labeled each vertex with a letter and each edge is named by the two vertexes it touches.
		</p>

		<p>
		2. Make a grid (above) with vertices on the y axis and edges on the x axis.  
		Put a 1 in cells that match vertices and edges, that is if the vertex corresponding with the row touches the edge of the corresponding column.
		</p>

<img style="height: 250px" src="/images/transform-empty.png"/>
		<p>
		3. Add a column labeled % (or whatever) to be used to count the number of vertices we pick.  
		These cells should all be 1s, as seen below.
		</p>
