	I recently started <a href="https://github.com/kjlubick/fb-contrib-eclipse-quick-fixes">a project called fb-contrib quickfixes</a> that focuses on creating quickfixes for FindBugs-detected bugs.  At first, it was a bit difficult, because, to my knowledge, there isn't a nice friendly "how to make a quickfix" tutorial, so I thought I'd make one.

	</p>

	<p>
	In this tutorial, we will make the following quickfix.

	This is a good start if you want to contribute quickfixes yourself to the project or if you want to make your own Eclipse quickfix plugin.  It fixes a bug called LSC_LITERAL_STRING_COMPARISON which, as you can see, is easily fixed by swapping the argument (the string literal) and the string variable (which could be null).

	For this tutorial, I'm providing an already setup Eclipse workspace, downloadable <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B6dzef3D5CTBSjk3MTRPSHZ2SEk">here</a>.  As of writing, the 3.0.0 version of the FindBugs plugin does not support extension, but a dev version does.  <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6dzef3D5CTBY0J1WTRVRXctVFE/edit">Here</a> is a compiled dev version (with fb-contrib bundled).  Uninstall FindBugs from Eclipse (if already installed) and then unzip the bundle and install it from Eclipse.  See http://stackoverflow.com/a/16074606/1447621 for more details. <br/>  If you want to do this in hard mode, follow the <a href="https://github.com/kjlubick/fb-contrib-eclipse-quick-fixes#setting-up-the-project-for-development">dev setup instructions</a> for fb-contrib quickfixes.
