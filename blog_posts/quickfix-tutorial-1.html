<div class="body">
	<p>
	I recently started <a href="https://github.com/kjlubick/fb-contrib-eclipse-quick-fixes">a project called fb-contrib quickfixes</a> that focuses on creating quickfixes for FindBugs-detected bugs.
	At first, it was a bit difficult, because, to my knowledge, there isn't a nice friendly "how to make a quickfix" tutorial, so I thought I'd make one.

	</p>

	<p>
	In this tutorial, we will make the following quickfix.
	<img src="images/quickfix-demo.gif"/>
	This is a good start if you want to contribute quickfixes yourself to the project or if you are interested in a hands-on exercise with abstract syntax trees (ASTs, for short - see below).
	It fixes a bug called LSC_LITERAL_STRING_COMPARISON which, as you can see, is easily fixed by swapping the argument (the <code class="language-java">String</code> literal) and the <code class="language-java">String</code> variable (which could be null).
	</p>

	<h3>Prerequisite: Abstract Syntax Trees</h3>
	<p>
	You will be writing software for Eclipse to perform the quickfixes, so I'll start discussing how Eclipse deals with Java source code - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">Abstract Syntax Trees</a> (ASTs).
	The Wikipedia article covers it well, but basically, ASTs are a semantic representation of the source code - Eclipse knows what each line is, whether it's an if statement, a variable initialization statement, etc.
	Let's look at an example of some source code and its representative AST.
	<pre data-src="blog_posts/code/quickfix-example.java" class="line-numbers"></pre>
	</p>

	<p>
	The outer-most <a href="http://help.eclipse.org/kepler/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.jdt.doc.isv%2Freference%2Fapi%2Forg%2Feclipse%2Fjdt%2Fcore%2Fdom%2FASTNode.html">ASTNode</a> is a <a href="http://help.eclipse.org/kepler/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.jdt.doc.isv%2Freference%2Fapi%2Forg%2Feclipse%2Fjdt%2Fcore%2Fdom%2FTypeDeclaration.html">TypeDeclaration</a> for the class <code class="language-java">ForQuickFixes</code>.
	TypeDeclarations have some bookkeeping things like <span class="mouseOverMe" title="in our case, we just have one - 'public'">modifiers</span>, a <span class="mouseOverMe" title="ForQuickFixes">name</span>, whether it's <span class="mouseOverMe" title="it isn't">an interface or not</span>, but we mostly care about the stuff inside of it, lines 3-7, which are the <a href="http://help.eclipse.org/kepler/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.jdt.doc.isv%2Freference%2Fapi%2Forg%2Feclipse%2Fjdt%2Fcore%2Fdom%2FAbstractTypeDeclaration.html&anchor=bodyDeclarations()">BodyDeclarations</a>.
	Remember, in a class, you can define fields, methods and other types, so that is what these are - an ordered list of all fields, methods and types defined in ForQuickFixes.  This happens to just be a single <a href="http://help.eclipse.org/kepler/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.jdt.doc.isv%2Freference%2Fapi%2Forg%2Feclipse%2Fjdt%2Fcore%2Fdom%2FMethodDeclaration.html">MethodDeclaration</a> that corresponds to our <code class="language-java">main</code> method.
	</p>

	<p>
	MethodDeclarations can also have bookkeeping things, like a  <span class="mouseOverMe" title="main">name</span>,  <span class="mouseOverMe" title="two this time - 'public' and 'static'">modifiers</span>, a list of  <span class="mouseOverMe" title="for our String array called args">arguments</span> (of type <a href="http://help.eclipse.org/kepler/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.jdt.doc.isv%2Freference%2Fapi%2Forg%2Feclipse%2Fjdt%2Fcore%2Fdom%2FSingleVariableDeclaration.html">SingleVariableDeclaration</a>), but if we are looking to fix Literal String Comparisons, we only really care about what goes on inside the method - <a href="http://help.eclipse.org/kepler/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.jdt.doc.isv%2Freference%2Fapi%2Forg%2Feclipse%2Fjdt%2Fcore%2Fdom%2FMethodDeclaration.html&anchor=getBody()">the body</a>.
	The body is a <a href="http://help.eclipse.org/kepler/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.jdt.doc.isv%2Freference%2Fapi%2Forg%2Feclipse%2Fjdt%2Fcore%2Fdom%2FBlock.html">Block</a>, which is basically a wrapper for a bunch of <a href="http://help.eclipse.org/kepler/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.jdt.doc.isv%2Freference%2Fapi%2Forg%2Feclipse%2Fjdt%2Fcore%2Fdom%2FStatement.html">Statement</a>s.
	</p>

	<p>
	<a href="http://help.eclipse.org/kepler/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.jdt.doc.isv%2Freference%2Fapi%2Forg%2Feclipse%2Fjdt%2Fcore%2Fdom%2FStatement.html">Statement</a>s
	are basically executable lines of code, so we run into them pretty frequently.
	In fact, our code snippet has 
	<span class="mouseOverMe" title="Technically the Blocks are Statements, but I tend to ignore them as actual Statements, reserving the term for actual lines of code.">two</span>
	statements, an <a href="http://help.eclipse.org/kepler/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.jdt.doc.isv%2Freference%2Fapi%2Forg%2Feclipse%2Fjdt%2Fcore%2Fdom%2FIfStatement.htmlIfStatement">IfStatement</a> and an <a href="http://help.eclipse.org/kepler/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.jdt.doc.isv%2Freference%2Fapi%2Forg%2Feclipse%2Fjdt%2Fcore%2Fdom%2FIfStatement.html">ExpressionStatement</a> corresponding to <code class="language-java">System.out.println("Test 1.0");</code>.
	Statements generally have other Statements nested inside of them, as well as <a href="http://help.eclipse.org/kepler/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.jdt.doc.isv%2Freference%2Fapi%2Forg%2Feclipse%2Fjdt%2Fcore%2Fdom%2FExpression.html">Expressions</a>, the other key building block that you will encounter a lot.  For example, the IfStatement is composed of other Statements and Expressions like this: 

	<pre data-src="blog_posts/code/quickfix-ifstatement.java" class="line-numbers"></pre>

	</p>

	<p>
	The Expression we are interested in is <code class="language-java">args[0].equals("version")</code>, which happens to be a <a href="http://help.eclipse.org/kepler/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.jdt.doc.isv%2Freference%2Fapi%2Forg%2Feclipse%2Fjdt%2Fcore%2Fdom%2FMethodInvocation.html">MethodInvocation</a> and it is currently the rightOperand of an <a href="http://help.eclipse.org/kepler/topic/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.isv/reference/api/org/eclipse/jdt/core/dom/InfixExpression.html">InfixExpression</a>.
	This MethodInvocation has a <span class="mouseOverMe" title="equals">name</span>, an <span class="mouseOverMe" title="args[0], which is technically an ArrayAccess object">expression</span> (aka the object upon which the method is invoked), and a <code class="language-java">List&lt;Type&gt;</code> of arguments.
	The one argument is a <a href="http://help.eclipse.org/kepler/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.jdt.doc.isv%2Freference%2Fapi%2Forg%2Feclipse%2Fjdt%2Fcore%2Fdom%2FStringLiteral.html">StringLiteral</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
	Discovering, reasoning about, and navigating this AST is much easier (for me, at least) when I use a tool called <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/jdt/ui/astview/index.php">ASTView</a>, which is an Eclipse plugin.

	<img src="images/quickfix-astview.gif"/>

	</p>

	<h3>Prerequisite: Visitor Pattern</h3>

	<p>
	An important tool for navigating the AST is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern">Visitor pattern</a>.  Basically what we will do is create an object which will be given to the AST.  The AST will ping the object with notifications as it navigates the passed-in object through the entire the tree.
	So, if we are interested in MethodInvocations, we will make the visiting object have a <code class="language-java">visit(MethodInvocation node)</code> method that will be called for every MethodInvocation in the AST, giving us a chance to poke around with all of the nodes.

	<p>
	For this tutorial, I'm providing an already setup Eclipse workspace, downloadable <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B6dzef3D5CTBSjk3MTRPSHZ2SEk">here</a>.
	As of writing, the 3.0.0 version of the FindBugs plugin does not support extension, but a dev version does.
	<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6dzef3D5CTBY0J1WTRVRXctVFE/edit">Here</a> is a compiled dev version (with fb-contrib bundled).
	Uninstall FindBugs from Eclipse (if already installed) and then unzip the bundle and install it from Eclipse.
	See <a target="_blank">http://stackoverflow.com/a/16074606/1447621</a> for more details.
	If you want to do this in hard mode, follow the <a href="https://github.com/kjlubick/fb-contrib-eclipse-quick-fixes#setting-up-the-project-for-development">dev setup instructions</a> for fb-contrib quickfixes - it will amount to basically the same thing.

	Read the two prerequisite sections above if you haven't already.
	You may also wish to install <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/jdt/ui/astview/index.php">ASTView</a> from above.
	</p>

	<h3>Registering a quickfix for a BugPattern</h3>

	<p>
	First, we need to start by registering our bug pattern to be fixed.
	We do this by updating the plugin.xml file, which is responsible for declaring how we are extending other Eclipse plugins (among other things).
	
	<div class="codeContainer">
        <pre data-src="blog_posts/code/quickfix-plugin.xml" class="line-numbers" data-line="1,3"></pre>
        <div class="codeComment">
            <span class="mouseComment" data-show="4-5">This tells Eclipse we are extending the quickfix plugin.
            We only need to specify this once, and nest 1 or more quickfix declarations inside. </span>
            <span class="mouseComment" data-show="8">This is the class that will contain our code to resolve the bug</span>
            <span class="mouseComment" data-show="9">Put the message here you want to display that explains what fix will be applied.
            Currently, it is a static message, but there are ways to have it be a dynamic message, covered in a later tutorial.
            By default, this will also be the description.
			<span id="label-vs-description" class="mouseOverMe">What's the difference between the label and description?</span>
            </span>
            <span class="mouseComment" data-show="10">Finally, this is the bug pattern we want to contribute to.
            Each bug pattern can have as many resolutions as you want.</span>
        </div>
    </div>

	<h3>The visitor</h3>

	<p>
	Now, we'll make the class we promised to make in plugin.xml - <code>LiteralStringComparisonResolution</code>.
	<code>BugResolution</code>, the superclass has two methods that we are required to overwrite.
	Moreover, we will 

	<div class="codeContainer">
        <pre data-src="blog_posts/code/quickfix-resolutionbase.java" class="line-numbers" data-line="1,3"></pre>
        <div class="codeComment">
            <span class="mouseComment" data-show="1">
            The ASTUtil class has a few great methods to avoid lots of boilerplate.
            </span>
            <span class="mouseComment" data-show="5-8">
            This method specifies whether we want access to the types (specifically, the <a href="http://help.eclipse.org/kepler/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.jdt.doc.isv%2Freference%2Fapi%2Forg%2Feclipse%2Fjdt%2Fcore%2Fdom%2FITypeBinding.html">ITypeBinding</a>s) of nodes.
            We do not need this for our visitor implementation (although the types could easily be included in the visitor logic). 
            In most cases, this should be <code class="language-java">true</code>, but, if you find yourself not needing to verify types, return <code class="language-java">false</code>, to improve performance.
            </span>
            <span class="mouseComment" data-show="11">
            This method will be called when the user has opted to fix the bug.  
            So, given these three variables, we need to find the buggy code and create a fix.
            </span>
            <span class="mouseComment" data-show="12-14">
            These three lines will appear in most every quickfix.
            What do they do?
            They find the node that contains the bug (line #12) and then traverse that node with the custom visitor (#13-14).
            </span>
            <span class="mouseComment" data-show="19-21">
            This is our custom node visitor.
            ASTVisitor has a bunch of visit methods, but they are all basically empty by default.
            We'll override the ones we want next.
            </span>
        </div>
    </div>

	</p>

	<p>
	Now, we'll code the visitor.  
	The purpose of the visitor will be to find the incorrect <code class="language-java">MethodInvocation</code> and
	also identify the <code class="language-java">String</code> literal and the <code class="language-java">String</code> variable so they can be swapped.
	Since we are looking for a <code class="language-java">MethodInvocation</code> to fix, we will override <code class="language-java">visit(MethodInvocation)</code> as seen below:
	
	<div class="codeContainer">
        <pre data-src="blog_posts/code/quickfix-visitor.java" class="line-numbers" data-line="1,3"></pre>
        <div class="codeComment">
            <span class="mouseComment" data-show="1">
            Remember, this is a class inside LiteralStringComparisonResolution.
            </span>
            <span class="mouseComment" data-show="4-6">
            We make a collection and initialize it via the static initializer with the three method names we are looking for.
            </span>
            <span class="mouseComment" data-show="9-11">
            These will be the three things we are looking for: the incorrect MethodInvocation,the String literal and the String variable.
            </span>
            <span class="mouseComment" data-show="14">
            The collections that ASTNodes return (such as <code class="language-java">arguments()</code>) are non-parameterized.  
            When we cast them (e.g. to a <code class="language-java">List&lt;Expression&gt;)</code>, this makes a compiler warning.
            This annotation silences said warning.
            </span>
            <span class="mouseComment" data-show="17+28">
            The return value indicates whether or not you want to traverse the subtree (true is the default value for all visit() calls).  We return false when we have found the MethodInvocation we are looking for, true otherwise.
            </span>
            <span class="mouseComment" data-show="19-21">
            To see if the MethodInvocation we are looking at is the one we want to fix, we check to see if the name matches something in our list and the first (and only) argument is a StringLiteral.
            It is technically possible for this logic to find (and then fix) the wrong method.
            For the purposes of this tutorial, I've decided to omit it, but if you want to see the type-checking version, see <a href="https://gist.github.com/kjlubick/2735ee7e640b407459ee">this gist</a>.

	<h3>Correcting the code</h3>
	<p>
		
	</p>

	<h3>Reflecting Thoughts</h3>
    <p>
    While I'd like to say this was all easily created, it was a bit of a struggle.
	ASTView helped some, but really what was useful was setting breakpoints, stepping through the various visitors and exploring the nodes with the Eclipse Debugging tools.
	Hopefully, this guide has made it easier to get a feel for the Eclipse quickfix platform than I had.  
	Along the way, I did run into some issues that others should not repeat:
 	
    <h4>Common Missteps</h4>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Don't use toString() for important logic:</b>
		As specified in the JavaDoc, the toString() methods are for debugging only!  Don't trust them to have real, accurate code
		(although they frequently do).  There's almost certainly a way to get the actual, correct string you need.  E.g. use SimpleName's getIdentifier() instead of the toString() to get the name of a method.</li>

		<li><b><code class="language-java">Foo f = new Foo()</code> is a <a href="http://help.eclipse.org/kepler/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.jdt.doc.isv%2Freference%2Fapi%2Forg%2Feclipse%2Fjdt%2Fcore%2Fdom%2FClassInstanceCreation.html">ClassInstanceCreation</a>, not a <a href="http://help.eclipse.org/kepler/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.jdt.doc.isv%2Freference%2Fapi%2Forg%2Feclipse%2Fjdt%2Fcore%2Fdom%2FConstructorInvocation.html">ConstructorInvocation</a>:</b>
		ConstructorInvocations, as it turns out, refer to an invocation of constructor from a similar constructor like <code>this(someVar,otherVar)</code>.  This was annoying and confusing for me when I was trying to deal with fixing constructors.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>

	<h3>What's next?</h3>


	<p>
	Stay tuned for the next iteration of this where we look to have a slightly more complicated example.  

	<!--I think the next example can be the InsecureRandom one, as it has custom descriptions and more than one resolution -->
	<!--The one after that can be EntrySetResolution, which has complex type manipulation and customized labels-->
