Angular update body

	Of course, dust hadn't even begun to settle on the new site before I learned about 
	<a href="http://www.polymer-project.org/">Polymer</a>, which seems to be on the cutting edge of web technology, at least
	according to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OJ7ih8EE7s&list=PLRAVCSU_HVYu-zlRaqArF8Ytwz1jlMOIM">this summer's Google I/O talks</a>.

	I was specifically interested in the Shadow DOM techniques, for isolating element's CSS, and the modules, like <code>code-explainer</code>, which is currently on their front page. <br/>
	<img title="code-explainer, from http://www.polymer-project.org/" src="images/polymer-code-explainer.png"/>

	This looks very nice, similar to the code explanations I've been experimenting with in my <a href="/#/blog/post/1?building-my-first-findbugs-detector">earlier blog post</a>.  I may consider migrating my "codeCommentary" package to Polymer, as my next forray into Web technology.
