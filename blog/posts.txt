	"<p class='log'>Code log entry 084: After roughly 187 minutes of analyzing using the <a href = 'http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/tools/share/jvisualvm.html'>Java Visual VM</a>, the cause of the non-terminating program was found.  A lone ExecutorService was found to have never been shutdown(), and the internal thread pool had been keeping the JVM from terminating.  A proper call to shutdown() was added to the offending class's stop() method, resolving the issue.</p>",
	
	"<p>The problem I ran into above was a painful one to track down, but my intuition said the problem would make for a great <a href='http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/'>FindBugs</a> detector because it dealt with omission of code, which is easy for static analysis to detect and generally time-consuming for humans to detect.</p>",
	
	"<p>What follows is how I designed a detector to hopefully make the struggles detailed in entry 084 obsolete.  It is meant for readers who have not yet implemented a FindBugs detector, but are curious at what it entails and what a sample workflow might be.</p>",

	"<p>When I implemented this detector, I contributed it to fb-contrib.  Pedagogically, if you don't have to worry about messing up the actual FindBugs code and you want to focus more on the detector and less on all of FindBugs internals, so I recommend doing the same for your first detector.</p>",
	
    "<p>This recipe assumes the following conditions: <ul>",
	"<li>You have the source code for both FindBugs and <a href='https://github.com/mebigfatguy/fb-contrib'>fb-contrib</a> downloaded and ready to build (I recommend Eclipse)</li>",
	"<li>You have read (or at least skimmed) Chris Grindstaff's <a href = 'https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-findbug2/'>high level overview</a> of building a FindBugs detector at least once.  Don't worry if you don't understand everything, we'll be covering a lot of the topics and, trust me, things get much clearer when you do them yourself.</li>",
	"<li>You've read the <a href='http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Executors.html'>JavaDoc</a> for Executors (the protagonist of our story) and perhaps browsed <a href='http://www.javacodegeeks.com/2013/01/java-thread-pool-example-using-executors-and-threadpoolexecutor.html'>this sample code</a> to get a feel for things.</li>",
	"<li>You have a JDK installed, and a reference to it in your path.</li></ul></p>",
	
	"<h3>Setting up our TestBed</h3>",
	'<p>If you have ever done Test Driven Development, writing your test code first is not a new idea.  For building FindBugs detectors, it is even more important because we need the source code to generate the Java bytecode that FindBugs scans.  I haven\'t found a way to make FindBugs operate in a unit test scenario (i.e. run tests and watch a green bar as they pass), but I still write test cases with code that should and should not work.</p>',
	
	"<p>Let's make a file, called HES_Sample.java, that will contain some buggy code.  I immediately replicated (and simplified) the case that caused me 3 hours of debugging to track down, as well as the fixed version:</p>",

    '<div class="codeComment"><span class="mouseComment" data-show="5+19">Lines 5 and 19: I tend to use this //tag and //no tag notation to indicate that FindBugs should put a notification on the next line.  </span>',
	'<span class="mouseComment" data-show="30">Line 30: This call to shutdown() is what we will look for to determine if an ExecutorService has to the potential to ever be shutdown, or not (like the example above)</span>',
	'<span class="mouseComment" data-show="34">Line 34: I made a dummy class to save on typing lots of anonymous classes. </span>',
	'</div></div>',
	"<p>For those of you thinking ahead, there are (at least) two more cases where ExecutorServices can be left hanging, or be misused, which we'll hit in later sections.</p>",
	
	"<h3>Finding some detector code to work with</h3>",
	"<p>Chris Grindstaff recommends finding a similar detector to base our new detector off, and I heartily agree, especially for the first, second or nth detector that you plan to write.</p>",
	
	"<p>There is no magic way to find a similar enough detector, but I've had luck browsing through the fb-contrib <a href='https://github.com/mebigfatguy/fb-contrib/blob/master/etc/messages.xml'>messages.xml</a> file until I find a message that seems familiar.  I, by a stroke of luck, had been recently improving the message on the <a href='https://github.com/kjlubick/fb-contrib/blob/0ca6d7b2b2ba74abe588630d55d04ae0924f94a4/src/com/mebigfatguy/fbcontrib/detect/PossibleMemoryBloat.java'>PMB_PossibleMemoryBloat detector</a>, which seemed like a good start.  It seems suitable because it detects collections that never get a call to remove(), clear() or similar methods (and thus always get larger but never get smaller), which is similar to what we want to do.</p>",

	'<p>You clever people in the audience may have guessed that to make our HangingExecutors detector work, all we will need to do is copy most of this code into our detector and modify <span class="code">bloatableSigs</span> from line 8 and <span class="code">decreasingMethods</span> from line 15 to our ExecutorService specific signatures and we\'d be basically done.  You clever folk would be <b>correct</b>.</p>',
	
	'<h4>Visitor Pattern Interlude</h4>',
	'<p>Before we get into how to modify this code to suit our needs, let\'s go over the interesting parts, that is, the snipped out code and see exactly how this detection thing works.  Before we get to it, I\'d like to give a quick refresher on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern">Visitor pattern</a> because the pattern is how detectors function -- FindBugs uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCEL">BCEL</a> to walk through the compiled Java bytecode and creates "events" every time it runs into things, the <span class="toolTip" title="visitCodeContext()">beginning of a class</span> or an <span class="toolTip" title="sawOpcode()">individual bytecode</span>, for instance. Our job is to override these listeners and keep track of the interesting bits to detect our bugs.</p>',
	
	'<p>Generally, you will need the following four visitor methods to make a detector (There are many more than these four, but these will do most of the job).  The order that these get called is: <br/><img src="images/detectors.png" title="The flow of the visitors for a BytecodeScanningDetector"/><br/>',

	'That is, for every class, visitClassContext() is called [in this method we tend to look at fields), then for every method, we get a visitMethod() [usually to get the name or reset the <span class="code toolTip" title="A tool for keeping track of the most recently seen opcodes">OpcodeStack</span>], then a visitCode() [similar to visitMethod()], and then for every <span class="toolTip" title="I\'ve been using opcode and bytecode a lot (for our purposes they are interchangable).  For the uninitiated, they are just a byte that is a machine instruction.">opcode</span>, a call to sawOpcode() is performed [the meat of most detectors goes here].</p>',
	
	'<h4>How does PossibleMemoryBloat work?</h4>',
	'<p>At a high level, PMB works in four steps:<ol><li>Find all <span class="code">Collection</span> fields and put them in <span class="code">bloatableCandidates</span>.</li><li>While parsing through all methods, see if things ever get added to the <span class="code">Collection</span> fields and add those to <span class="code">bloatableFields</span>.</li> <li>While parsing through all methods, remove any fields that get a call to clear(), remove() or similar.</li> <li>Report bugs on all remaining <span class="code">Collection</span> fields.</li> </ol> </p>',
	
	"<p>This seems straight forward enough.  Because <span class='code'>ExecutorService</span>s are just dangerous if they don't get shutdown, our detector will omit step 2, but I'll still walk through the original PMB source code for that step.  </p>",

	"<span class='mouseComment' data-show=25-28>It's pretty typical to force any fields back to null for garbage collection to occur after you are done with the class context.</span>",
	"<span class='mouseComment' data-show=33-34>This is how you can access all the fields in a class.  Note that <span class='code'>Field</span> is the BCEL object (read: not FindBugs message compatible) and <span class='code'>XField</span>, created on line 39, is the FindBugs version (which adds some extra functionality).</span>",
	"<span class='mouseComment' data-show=37>The detector only looks at static fields, which will be around for longer than local variables, and thus more prone to bloat.</span>",
	"<span class='mouseComment' data-show=39>When at all possible, it is best to convert the BCEL objects (like <span class='code'>Field</span>, <span class='code'>Method</span>, <span class='code'>ClassDescriptor</span>) and turn them into their FindBug's equivalent (<span class='code'>XField</span>, <span class='code'>XMethod</span> and <span class='code'>XClass</span>) using the convenience\ methods in <span class='code'>XFactory</span></span>",

For now, don't worry about the <span class='code'>this</span>, just know that we need to have it and the name of the bug.

	"<span class='mouseComment' data-show=53+62>To make the message include the name of the field and make bug appear at the right line number, we need a field annotation, which we cached in parseFields().
