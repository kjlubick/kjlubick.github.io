	<p>
	Today, I gave a 1 hour talk based on my recent learnings of Quantum Computing.
	It's called <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14TBxHvTzJxi5CunKHXKnxez4zi8Cr_1h5vNJPyBOmbI/edit">Quantum Computing without too much math</a>.
	I think the slides are pretty readable in the absence of my voice - shoot me an email if anything is super confusing, or if you have suggestions for improvements.
	</p>

	<p>
	I hope to use the slides (and what I had to cut) as the basis of the future blog posts I alluded to in the last post.
