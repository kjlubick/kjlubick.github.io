	While on vacation, I sat down and finally got through <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Quantum-Computing-Computer-Scientists-Yanofsky/dp/0521879965">Quantum Computing for Computer Scientists</a>.  I think I understand the fundamentals, <b>and</b> I think I can explain it in relatively simple terms.

	<p>Coming soon, a multi-part series I'm calling "Quantum Computing without too much math".</p>
